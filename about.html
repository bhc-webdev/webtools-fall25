            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                At <strong>Launch Studio</strong>, we believe learning web development should feel like
                stepping into your first professional role. Think of us as a creative workspace
                where students transform curiosity into real-world skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aren’t just building websites — we’re building confidence, collaboration,
                and career-ready habits. Every project you tackle here is designed to feel
                like an authentic assignment you might receive from a client or supervisor
                in the field.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                To provide aspiring developers with hands-on, project-based experiences that
                bridge the gap between classroom learning and professional practice.
            </p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a studio-like environment where students work on real-world challenges.</li>
                <li>Encourage problem-solving, debugging, and documentation as everyday habits.</li>
                <li>Connect tools like <code>VS Code</code>, <code>GitHub</code>, and modern web frameworks to authentic
                    workflows.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>
                The web is constantly evolving, and so are we. By practicing in Launch Studio,
                students don’t just learn <em>what</em> to code — they learn <em>how</em> to
                think like developers, adapt to new tools, and collaborate effectively.
